# Drawing-Bot
This is a comprehensive Full-stack application that bridges the gap between natural language and visual art. The app allows users to give instructions in plain English (e.g., "Draw a blue house with a yellow sun"), which are then interpreted by a Large Language Model (LLM) and rendered instantly on an interactive HTML5 Canvas.
